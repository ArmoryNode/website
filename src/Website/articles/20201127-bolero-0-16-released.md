subtitle: Updated to the latest and greatest version of .NET
---

We are happy to announce the release of [Bolero](https://fsbolero.io) version 0.16. Bolero is a library that enables writing full-stack applications in F#, whose client side runs in WebAssembly using Blazor.

This release updates Bolero for the brand new [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)! You can now take advantage of .NET 5's improvements in your F# application, including better performance both in server-side and WebAssembly modes, and improved trimming for smaller WebAssembly download sizes.

Install the latest project template with:

```
dotnet new -i Bolero.Templates::0.16.5
```

or follow the [upgrade guide](https://fsbolero.io/docs/Upgrade) for your existing projects.

Happy coding!
